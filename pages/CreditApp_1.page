                In order to process purchase orders, SunPower Corporation requires all Dealers/Customers to either establish a credit limit or prepay and submit a valid reseller's certificate form that is signed and dated in order to be tax exempt. Please follow the directions so we may conduct a credit evaluation. This will stream-line order handling and eliminate unnecessary delays in shipments to your customers. Thank you for your cooperation. We look forward to working with you to install solar energy systems.

                <span><b><u>FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.</u> Any dealer operating for more than one (1) year must submit financial statements with their application. Those operating less than one (1) year must submit their most recent tax return.</b></span></Div>The required statements include an income statement spanning more than six (6) months and a current balance sheet. Audited financial statements or tax returns are preferred and will be treated with preference, but any system-generated statements (i.e. QuickBooks) will suffice. Those signing a personal guarantee, operating their business as a sole proprietorship or partnership must also complete and submit Small Business Association Form 413. This form can be obtained at <u>http://www.sba.gov/sbaforms/sba413.pdf.</u>

A personal guaranty will be required for companies with little or no financial history. The personal credit history of the owner will then be factor into the credit evaluation process in order to establish the overall credit limit. All personal guaranties submitted must be notarized.

A SunPower Dealer can increase their credit limit by making some or all of their SLOC available to SunPower. This can be for the duration of a current project, or longer to maintain a higher credit limit with SunPower. Share Attachment C with your bank as an example. Please attach a copy of the SLOC to your application and send the original to our corporate address to the attention of the Credit Department.
