Dear {!Account.Name},

Good day!

We are pleased to let you know that we have completed the required support from us to move forward with your refinance. This is in reference to case number {!Case.CaseNumber}; with case manager {!Case.OwnerFullName}.

To summarize, we have provided the following documents to you and to your escrow/lender:

Termination of the UCC fixture that will be recorded by your escrow to the county
Notarized subordination document to be signed by you and recorded by your escrow/lender to the county (for CA states only)
Refinance Invoice for the $100.00 fee which will be collected at closing

With this, we will now be closing the case as COMPLETED. Please be advised that there will be a quick survey that will be sent to you separately. This is to measure the customer service provided and we would appreciate to hear back from you.

We are constantly striving to provide excellent service; please leave us a note on the comment section of the survey if you feel there is anything else we can do to make your experience even better.


FOR ESCROW/LENDER:

Thank you again for allowing us to help you with this refinance transaction. If you can find time to participate in our Customer Service Survey, we would love to hear your feedback. Simply respond to this email with your comments and suggestions to make your experience even better.


We appreciate your time and attention on this matter.


Thank you!
