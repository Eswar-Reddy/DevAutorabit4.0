Refinance Request Case {!Case.CaseNumber}
Lease#: {!Case.Lease__c}


Hi {!Account.Name},

We were notified by your escrow/lender that you are currently refinancing your home. However, it shows in our record that you have a monthly lease payment still due. We would be happy to resume this request soon as the account is cleared.

For over the phone payments, please call 1-800-321-1770, Option 2.

Note the case for this request will be discontinued. Kindly notify us soon as you have made your payment so we may create a new case for you.

Should you have further concerns or queries, kindly send a NEW email with the lease# or property address on the subject line.


IMPORTANT: Do not reply on this email.


Thank you!
