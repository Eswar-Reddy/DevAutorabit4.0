Dear {!Account.Name},

We have been notified by your escrow/lender that you are in the process of refinancing your home. We will work directly with your escrow/lender to complete the required documents.

During your refinance process, SunPower will terminate the fixture filing on SunPower System.
Most refinance requests are completed within five (5) business days.
There is a $100.00 documentation fee for this transaction. This is usually collected and paid by your lender once your refinance is completed.

Should you have any concerns or queries feel free to email us at refinance@sunpower.com or call 1-800-321-1770.



SunPower Case Manager Contact Information:

Name: {!Case.OwnerFullName}

Email: refinance@sunpower.com

Case#: {!Case.CaseNumber}



To Escrow or borrower&apos;s representative (For CA states only): Kindly confirm if you or your lender will need to Subordinate the Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract. If so, please send a shipping label (FedEx or UPS) so we may overnight the original Subordination document back to your office.



Important Note: Kindly reply to this email thread in order for us to locate the emails faster and respond accordingly.


Thank you!
