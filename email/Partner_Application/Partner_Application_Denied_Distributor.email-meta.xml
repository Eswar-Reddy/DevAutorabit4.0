    <subject>Information Regarding your SunPower Partner Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in becoming a Partner with SunPower.

SunPower is currently only looking to recruit contractor partners that are interested in selling, designing and installing SunPower systems directly for home-owning end-customers. At this time we are not focusing on partnership opportunities with distributors.

We would like to keep your information on file and continue the evaluation process if we decide to explore partnership opportunities with distribution organizations in the future.

If you would prefer not to be contacted for future consideration, please email us and we will make sure we comply with your request.
 
Once again, we thank you for your time and wish you all the best!

Regards,

{!User.FirstName}
