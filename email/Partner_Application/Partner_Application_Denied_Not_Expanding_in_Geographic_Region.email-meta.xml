    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in joining SunPower&apos;s industry leading network of dealers.

At this time SunPower is not looking to expand into the geographic markets that you have determined on your partner application form.

We would like to keep your information on file and continue the evaluation process if we decide to expand into your regional market. 

Once again, we thank you for your time and interest. We look forward to speaking with you again in the near future!
 
Regards, 
{!User.FirstName}
