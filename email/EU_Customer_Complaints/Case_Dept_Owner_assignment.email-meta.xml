    <textOnly>Hi “PSR name”,

you are the Case Owner for this case and you will lead it with the Partner/Customer until the closure of the case.

Department Owner for this case is “Logistic” and they will provide you with temporary solution (P5-follow up) and final solution (P30-Case closure).

Case Owner tasks: communicate the Partner/Customer their complaint status and update SF with P5/P30 actions (communication with the Partner has to be uploaded on SF) and expedite case with Dept. Owner (weekly basis follow up requesting them a solution as soon as possible, within 30 days).

Dept. Owner tasks: provide Case Owner with the solution (P5 temporary solution &amp; P30 final solution), implement and verify the solution.

Many thanks for your support,

Regards
