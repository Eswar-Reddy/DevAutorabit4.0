    <subject>SunPower – The Most Powerful Solar: Web Inquiry Response</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name},

Thank you for your interest in SunPower, The World&apos;s Standard for Solar.

We are sending this e-mail in response to the web inquiry you made about solar for your home.

Homeowners with low usage and low electric rate have to spend a bit more in the short term for solar as compared to those with high usage and high rates, which, in effect, start saving immediately. In the long term, everyone will save money by going solar as utility rates continue to rise (while your solar costs are fixed), but the payback time varies based on the usage.  

In line with that, it would be financially reasonable if your electric bill is more than $100, or the energy consumption is 4-6kw, for you to be able to maximize the efficiency of the solar electric system. 

For more information, you may visit our website www.sunpowercorp.com or call our Customer Care Hotline at 1-800-SUNPOWER (1-800-786-7693).


Regards,
