    <textOnly>Dear Customer, 

Thank you for contacting SunPower. This is to follow-up on the inquiry you made last (month-day-year). I am happy to let you know we have issued approval for (dealer’s name) on (month-day-year)  to request interconnection permission from your utility. 

What’s next? 

•	Your utility will inspect your system and grant permission for connection to the grid. 
•	The time from this notice to the actual interconnection depends on how quickly your local utility can schedule an inspection of your system. Talk with your SunPower installation team to get a sense of your local utility’s turn-around time.

I am now closing the reference number created on our last conversation. A short survey will be sent to you to evaluate your experience with the SunPower Customer Support Team member who handled your inquiry. 

If you feel this issue is not yet resolved or you have another question or concern, please contact SunPower Customer Support at: 1-800 SunPower or at CustomerSupport@SunPowerCorp.com 


Thank you,
(Your Name Here)
