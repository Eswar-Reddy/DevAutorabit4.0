    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:



Thank you for contacting SunPower for authorization to subcontract your lease installations.  You should already have a Master Subcontractor Authorization Agreement on file with SunPower, and shortly you will receive an EchoSign email that contains a link to the Lease Subcontractor Authorization agreement.  EchoSign is an electronic signature process that meets all legal requirements.  Please review the agreement and, if you have questions, reach out to your SunPower Sales Manager.  Once you are satisfied with the terms, please follow the EchoSign instructions to sign the document and provide the Subcontractor information requested.


Best Regards,

The SunPower Channel Management Team
