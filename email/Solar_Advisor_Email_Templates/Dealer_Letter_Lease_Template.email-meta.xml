    <subject>SunPower Lease Dealer Participation Agreement (DPA)</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear SunPower Dealer Partner,


Thank you for your interest in participating in the SunPower Lease Program. Your SunPower Sales Manager has requested we forward the SunPower Residential Lease Dealer Participation Agreement (DPA) for your review and signature.


We use an online signature technology - EchoSign - that complies with all legal standards and attaches a digital signature to secure electronic documents. Please look for an email from EchoSign in the next few moments. You will need to electronically sign the DPA document, as well as complete a couple of fields. The document is password protected; we will contact you separately with this information. After we receive your response, a fully executed copy will be returned to you for good standing order of your files.


We recognize that this is a long legal document; we’d like to call out a few key features and urge you to discuss the agreement with your SunPower Sales Manager or our customer-financing group (financing@sunpowercorp.com).

Dealer partners must enroll as a SunPower supplier to participate (see Exhibit F of the DPA for requirements). We will make a checklist available to you after this agreement is executed.

The price of the system cannot exceed $7.00/DC watt.

There is a program participation fee of $40/month per user license for 1-5 users and $30/month per user for succeeding users.  This provides your team members with access to proposal and lease origination systems. We’ll bill you for this fee monthly via a debit memo.


Once this agreement has been executed, you will automatically be provided with access to our lease training and information modules via the dealer portal. You will not be able to transact a lease until you are set up as a SunPower supplier.



Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you for years to come.



Regards,


SunPower Lease Program</textOnly>
