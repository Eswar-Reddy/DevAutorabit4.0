To make it easy for you to manage and update this opportunity we’re sending you a direct link to the Opportunity record below, along with the follow-up process for SunPower Opportunities.<br></font><font size="2"><br><br><b>SunPower Lead Contact Process:</b><br><br>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please&nbsp;<b>contact these opportunities&nbsp;<u>via phone</u></b>&nbsp;to schedule or confirm a site visit. The faster the follow-up, the higher the likelihood that you’ll be successful in setting an appointment. Please note that sending the lead an email without an initial phone call does not lead to higher appointment setting rates and does not qualify as ‘Contacted’.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have contacted the opportunity and spoken with the prospect (or left a voicemail message), please update the&nbsp;<b>OPPORTUNITY STAGE field to “Contacted” in the Dealer Portal. You can link directly to the opportunity via desktop browser here:</b></font><div><font size="2"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font size="2"><b><font color="#3333FF"><a href="https://c.na29.content.force.com/email/{!Opportunity.Link}">{!Opportunity.Name}</a></font></b></font><div><font size="2"><br></font></div><div><font size="2">&nbsp;<br></font><font size="2"><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">NOTE, if you are viewing this message on your mobile device, and you are a mobile user, then you can navigate to the Opportunity from this link: &nbsp;</span><a href="https://sunpower1.force.com/partners/one/one.app">https://sunpower1.force.com/partners/one/one.app</a>&nbsp;</p></font><font size="2"><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are not able to contact the opportunity during your first attempt please leave a voicemail and send an email to the prospect letting them know that you are trying to reach them to set up a time for an in-home visit.&nbsp;<b>Making at least 3 contact attempts</b>&nbsp;within the first 2 weeks of receiving a lead is best practice to set the highest number of appointments. If you are unable to contact the opportunity, please update the Opportunity Stage to “Opportunity Lost” with Reason Won/Lost of “Dormant”.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should plan to reconnect with any non-responsive leads once a month via phone or email - many dealers utilize this strategy to create closes with little incremental effort.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If for any reason you receive a lead that you feel should not have been assigned to you, please contact&nbsp;<font color="#3333FF">customersupport@sunpowercorp.com</font>&nbsp;<b>immediately&nbsp;</b>so that the lead can be reassigned and to ensure this lead does not impact your Dealer Performance score.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Theo Ludwick<br>Manager, RLC Demand Generation Programs<br><font color="#3333FF">marketing@sunpower.com</font><br>&nbsp;<br><font color="#3333FF">www.sunpower.com</font><br>855-977-7867</font></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td style="height: 0px; background-color: rgb(170, 170, 255);"></td></tr><tr valign="top"></tr></tbody></table><br>]]></td>
