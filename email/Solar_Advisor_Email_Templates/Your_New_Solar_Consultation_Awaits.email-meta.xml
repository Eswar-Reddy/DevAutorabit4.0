    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I am sorry we haven’t been able to connect this week. We understand how many decisions are involved in the purchase of a new home and are here to help. With limited time remaining to select your new home options, SunPower is here to help you make an informed decision on how best to power your home

All we need to do is schedule an appointment with one of our knowledgeable Energy Consultants. The appointment will be a quick 15 minute phone call where your solar energy advisor will discuss how going solar can save you money. Below are some of the frequently asked questions that we can address:



•

How does solar work?

•

Am I eligible for the 30% federal tax credit?

•

Are there state rebates for new homes too?

•

Is solar exempt from property taxes?

•

How long is the system warrantied?



To schedule an appointment, just give me a call or reply to this email with a few times that work for you. I’ll schedule the appointment and send you a confirmation email with the details.
