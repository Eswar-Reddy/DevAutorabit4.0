    <subject>SunPower – The Most Powerful Solar: Web Inquiry Response</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name},

Thank you for your interest in SunPower, The World&apos;s Standard for Solar.

We are sending this e-mail in response to the web inquiry you made about solar for your home.

At this time, we can only install solar systems for homeowners due to permitting and liability issues that normally prevent tenants from purchasing solar systems. You may want to let your landlord know and encourage him to become a solar advocate, since their permission would be required prior to installation.

For more information, you may visit our website www.sunpowercorp.com or call our Customer Care Hotline at 1-800-SUNPOWER (1-800-786-7693).


Regards, 

{!Lead.OwnerFirstName}
