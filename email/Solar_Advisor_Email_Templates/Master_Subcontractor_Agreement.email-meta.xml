    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:


Thank you for contacting SunPower for authorization to subcontract your cash installations.  Shortly, you will receive an EchoSign email that contains a link to the Subcontractor Authorization agreement.  EchoSign is an electronic signature process that meets all legal requirements.  Please review the agreement and, if you have questions, reach out to your SunPower Sales Manager.  Once you are satisfied with the terms, please follow the EchoSign instructions to:



1. provide the Subcontractor information request in Exhibit A and



2. sign the document
