    <subject>Energy Consultation for your new KB Home.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Mr. or Mrs. {!Lead.LastName},


I wanted to follow up on our phone call regarding your Energy Consultation for your new KB Home.  Unfortunately, we got disconnected on our call and didn’t get a chance to schedule your energy consultation.


SunPower is KB Home’s dedicated solar partner and KB Home has asked us to provide all of their home buyers with an Energy Consultation.


Just like your design center appointment, the objective of the energy consultation is give you a chance to choose your electricity provider(s).


As a result of recent changes in the new home and utility industries, new home buyers can now choose how and from who they buy their electricity.


Please email me and let me know when might be a good time to schedule your energy consultation or you can also call me directly to schedule it.  Thanks in advance for your time.</textOnly>
