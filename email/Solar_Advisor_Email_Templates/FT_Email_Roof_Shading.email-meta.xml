    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

Thank you for your interest in SunPower! We received your inquiry on our solar electric system and we are pre-evaluating your home for solar.

Based on the satellite view of your home at {!Opportunity.Customer_Street__c}, {!Opportunity.Customer_City__c} {!Opportunity.Customer_State__c} {!Opportunity.Customer_Zip__c}, there are trees that cause shading issues on your roof. This can greatly affect the system production and your savings and we suggest if they can be trimmed, if not cut to an ideal length. Let us know if you are affirmative on this or not so we can move forward with your solar evaluation.

Please call us at 1-800-SUNPOWER (1-800-786-7693) and speak with one of our Solar Advisors today!


Best regards,
