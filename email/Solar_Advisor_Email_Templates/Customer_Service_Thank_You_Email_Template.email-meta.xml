    <textOnly>Dear (Customer’s First Name),

Thank you for your response. We will forward your information to the best Partner in your area, (Partner Name).  (Paste Dealer Plug here!).

(Partner Name) will contact you within 2 business days to schedule an appointment for an onsite evaluation. You may visit their website at (www.XYZ.com) and their phone number is ###-###-####.  

It’s always helpful if you have prior electric bills handy to show your Partner, who can then use this information to determine your solar needs.

If you have any questions or need additional information, please give me a call at 1-800-SUNPOWER (1-800-786-7693), and I’ll be happy to assist you.

Thank you for your interest in SunPower.


Best Regards,
