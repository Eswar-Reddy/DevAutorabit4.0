    <textOnly>Dear {!Case.Partner_Name__c},

Please be informed that we are now assigning this service request to a 3rd party contractor due to no response.

You no longer need to contact the homeowner for troubleshooting or reconnecting the monitoring system.

In addition, SunPower will not compensate for repairs without your acknowledgement prior the site visit. 

For further assistance, please respond to this email or call 1-800-SUNPOWER and our team of experts will be happy to assist you.


Regards,
