Dear Valued Customer,


At SunPower, our mission is to change the way our world is powered by providing the best solar energy products and service in the industry. That being said, an unforeseen database issue has arisen with our SunPower Monitoring System. The result of this error is the “poaching” or sharing of data from other nearby systems in your neighborhood that prevents us from connecting your monitoring system. We are fully aware of this issue and are working diligently to correct it.

You can expect your system reporting to be fully restored within the next 14 to 21 days. During this time, we want to assure you that this is a monitoring issue only and your solar system is fully operating as designed. Your solar panels are directly connected to your main electric panel and meter so you are receiving full credit from your local utility for all energy your system is producing.

We regret that you are unable to receive accurate system performance data and we thank you for your patience while we rectify the issue. In the meantime, if you have any questions regarding the status of your repair please call us at 877-344-6637, or email us at Residential.Service@sunpowercorp.com.



Best Regards,

SunPower Customer Care</textOnly>
