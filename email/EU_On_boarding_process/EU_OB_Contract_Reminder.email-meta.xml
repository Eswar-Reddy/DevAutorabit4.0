    <textOnly>Good morning {!Contact.FirstName}. You will recall that I contacted you last week regarding the SunPower {!Contract.Contract_Type__c}. The contract was routed to you via EchoSign that day. Please let us know if you have not received a message from EchoSign with the agreement or have had any problems signing.

Thank you for your consideration.
