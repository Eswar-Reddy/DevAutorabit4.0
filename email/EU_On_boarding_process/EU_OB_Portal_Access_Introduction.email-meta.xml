    <textOnly>Good afternoon {!Contact.FirstName}. I manage partner experience for SunPower dealers in North America. You have recently joined our dealer network and I am working on providing you access to our customer portal and training site. You will shortly receive an automated message from SunPower Customer Care with your credentials. There is a short delay in this login information being ported to our training system. You should be able to navigate to SunPower University (from the link on the left) in a few hours.

Thank you for choosing to work with SunPower.

Regards,

Tom Dowley
