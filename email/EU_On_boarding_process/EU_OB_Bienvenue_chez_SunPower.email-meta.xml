    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}: 

Thank you for making the choice to partner with SunPower. We are very excited to work with you through our North American Residential Dealer Program. As a Partner Experience Manager with SunPower, I will be available to assist you as you come up to speed with our solar solutions and business processes.
 
We have a Dealer Portal that provides access to design tools, program guidelines, our MRC (Marketing Resource Center), the SunPower University, etc. As part of our partner &apos;on boarding&apos; process, we can help you create profiles in the portal. These would include users needing full access, and other that are primarily learners - looking for documents, content and training. We have attached an Excel file that can be used to communicate this user information to us. The Training Liaison will be able to enroll your employees in instructor lead courses. You can also call 1-800-SUNPOWER for assistance with enrollment. The Portal Champion can grant access to the dealer portal. You can return this completed form via e-mail.
