Below are the stats on target audience, distribution numbers….
 
Print run for Solar Today’s Get Started issue last year was 120,000. Most of those are distributed to visitors to the National Solar Tour, Oct. 2. About 20,000 are mailed out to subscribers on Sept. 15. Target audiences are ASES members and homeowners visiting the National Solar Tour because they’re interested in buying home energy upgrades.
