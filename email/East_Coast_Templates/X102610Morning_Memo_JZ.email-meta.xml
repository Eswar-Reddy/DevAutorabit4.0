    <textOnly>Turning Bigger
Profits
 
 
We are in the final quarter of the year and there is a huge surge to get as many systems installed by the end of the year to try to &apos;make money&apos;.  Once this surge is over, it is time to start looking at other ways to make money.
 
You can actually turn a better profit without selling more.  How can this be?  When things are as robust as they are in the solar industry there is a lot of wasted profit.  Think about this.  
 
&quot;A dollar saved is a dollar earned, but a dollar of revenue is about $.30 of profit.&quot;
 
This means if you can save a dollar on the back end of your business, that is an extra dollar of profit in your bank account, that is an extra dollar you can put towards marketing or that is the difference between turning a profit and losing money!
 
What can you do in Q1, when things are a little calmer, that will impact your business for Q2-Q4 of 2011 and help you turn a larger profit?  There are a lot of companies, in other industries, that are going through this right now because they are being forced to.  If you ask any of them, they sure wish they had made these changes when things were good as their businesses would be far better off today.

Tools for the job

 
Did you know that it&apos;s been estimated that it takes 10 years or 10,000 hours to truly MASTER any skill?
 
A best-selling author named Malcolm Gladwell wrote a fascinating book (&quot;Outliers&quot;) on this very subject.  He reported that the Beatles had been playing together in dive bars for SEVEN years before they became an &quot;overnight&quot; sensation.
 
Estimates are the band performed 1,200 times before their big success in 1964. By comparison, most bands don&apos;t perform 1,200 times in their CAREERS!
 
Neurologist Daniel Levitin has studied the formula for success extensively and shares this finding: &quot;The emerging picture from such studies is that 10,000 hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything.&quot;
 
Over and over again, no matter what the field, experts are finding that PREPARATION counts more than TALENT.
 
Now I don&apos;t know about you, but I find this incredibly exciting news.  Sure, no one wants to hear that it takes a lot of time to get really good at something.  But let&apos;s not forget that the &quot;10,000 hour rule&quot; applies to those aspiring to be world-class masters.
 
To be better than the rest, you just have to put in the effort.  I can assure you most people out there aren’t putting in the effort near the level that they should be, and we offer the BEST Sales, Design and Installation classes in the industry and that’s a great place to start and it shouldn’t end there.
