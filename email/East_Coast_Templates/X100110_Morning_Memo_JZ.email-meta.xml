    <textOnly>E-Series &amp;
Serengeti
 
 
Do you understand the E-Series strategy?  Consumers buy on differences, not similarities.  When everything is the same, it comes down to price.  SunPower has been working hard to arm you with the tools you need to sell more systems in your market and it comes in the form of the E-Series &amp; the new Serengeti product.
 
SunPower has always been known for its high efficiency panels within the industry!  Let&apos;s make it our goal to inform consumers about high efficiency and what that means to them.  It means more energy produced and lower electric bills!  To the average consumer all panels are the same and it is your job to teach them about converting more sunlight to energy at the highest rate possible.  This is where you and your company can stand apart from the rest of your competitors.
 
Well, you say your customer is on a budget and they just can&apos;t swing the highest producing solar panels on the planet.  Now is the time to introduce the E-13/Serengeti product.  It is still manufactured by SunPower, the largest residential install base in North America, but it will compete with other &apos;standard&apos; efficiency panels.
 
If you more help on how to sell this through to your customers, just let me know and we can setup a time to work through this.
 

 
 Home Values

 
 
 
I have a great article on the impact that solar systems have on a home’s value.  This is something you may want to share with a potential customer.
 
Many customers are looking at solar as an investment.  If there house goes up in value the day their system is installed it has paid for itself on day one!  Everything from that point forward is profit!  
 
Shoot me a quick reply letting me know you want this article and I will send it over to you.

 
 
$100,000,000
$100,000,000 is a lot of money!  Do you want your piece of it?  SunPower is close to hitting the $100,000,000 mark for systems financed!  Are you offering financing or not?  Let&apos;s make sure every potential customer knows they can finance their new system.
 
In the last report I received for my region, 95% of the consumers that applied for financing with us were approved!  That is amazing.  Now we just need to let more people now that we offer it.  The easier you can make it for them to put solar on their house, the more people that will sign contracts.
 
Let&apos;s stop trying to justify the payment.  We (as an industry) try to justify it as a good buy when the payment is less than what they pay in electricity.  Let&apos;s stop that!  Our payment has an end date, it should be more!  Will their current payments ever end if they don&apos;t buy solar?
 
Think about this.  If I offered to sell you gasoline for $6.00/gallon for the next 5 years but it would be free for the rest of your life, would you do it?  I know I would!
 
Salespeople on the roof?
 
I have something for you to consider.  

Have you told your insurance company your salespeople are going on the roof?
What would it cost you if one of these folks fall off the roof?  Less than $50, probably a lot more than $50/
How often are the designs or estimates that are brought in by the Sales staff correct or not to the liking of the installation crew?
How much time is your installation crew spending trying to figure out what the salesperson designed or other ways to make the system work?
                
Go into Google and enter the search &quot;roof measurements from satellite&quot;.  There will be multiple options for services to use.  Yes, you have to pay for these services but considering the hidden costs above it is probably a wise investment.  Let&apos;s keep our salespeople selling and our designers/installers doing what they do best!
 
The paid services will give you just as accurate of a measurement as the sales person and without the risk.</textOnly>
