Do you know that you can give your customers as much as $225.00 and it doesn&apos;t cost you a cent?  How can this be?  It is another great advantage of being partnered with SunPower.
 
You need to check out www.spreadsunpower.com to see it for yourself!  
 
Here is how it works.  Your customers go in and enter the name of someone they know that may be interested in solar.  When that person sets up a Home Solar Evaluation with you, both the customer and the person they referred will receive a $25 Visa Gift Card.  If the person who was referred purchases a system both parties will receive an additional $200 Visa Gift Card!
 
This is a great way to drive more business to you without costing you any money!  Make sure you include this website in all communications you send our to your existing customer base!
 
 
Lead Management 
 

 
 
 
Lead Management is directed to your Closing Ratio!  Even the best sales people in the world are usually closing less than 50%!  This is where Lead Management comes in.
 
If you close 25% of your potential customers, that means 75% didn&apos;t purchase from you!  Now, tt is far easier and more cost effective to nurture these leads than it is to find new leads.  This is an Effective Lead Management System comes in.
 
What is an Effective Lead Management System?  This is a system that every single lead will flow through.  Not, &quot;well I will call them next week&quot; or &quot;I sent them an email&quot;.  I challenge you to put together a system and then follow it!  I encourage you to contact your leads 9 times in 90 days.
 
You may think this is overkill but if you have an effective system, it is actually a soft approach of staying in front of your potential customer when they may be looking at your competitors.  I am not saying call them 9 times in 90 days.  This would be pushy.  The key is using all of the different ways to contact them.  If done properly it shows that you are a true Sales Professional!
 
If you would like to discuss this further, please let me know and I would be happy to help you put together a system that will help you close more deals!

 
 
Financing 
 
Have you made Financing a bigger part of your sales presentation yet?  If not, you are missing out on huge opportunities.  Customers will not admit that they don&apos;t have the money to purchase a system from you.  They will come up with other excuses to not have to buy.
 
It is your responsibility to make sure they know they can finance.  I recommend you treat every presentation as if they are going to finance.  If they have other means to pay, your job just got easier.
 
Look at other industries that are driven by financing.  Those that can still offer it are doing okay.  Those that can&apos;t offer financing are really suffering.  The Home Industry would kill to be able to offer financing similar to our Same-As-Cash Loan and our Solar Loan!  They relied on Home Equity and now they are struggling.
 
It is your responsibility to understand these programs so you can speak intelligently about them with your customers.  IF you don&apos;t know what you are talking about when your customers ask questions, they will not be comfortable moving forward with these programs.
