    <textOnly>Have you seen the new Marketing Resource Center?  There are some amazing new tools you NEED to be taking advantage of!
The Quarterly Campaign

The multi-touch campaign provides you with a cost-effective way to
look for new customers with high-quality and co-branded marketing collateral.
SunPower Marketing Resource Center (MRC) will update this material on a
quarterly basis to ensure that your marketing is always fresh and effective.

 

Multi-touch campaign

1.   A 5x9
postcard will be mailed to your list on the designated date. 

2.   If we
don’t hear from the prospect, we’ll send them another 5x9 postcard with
different messaging 10 days later. 

3.   If
the prospect doesn’t ask for a quote, we’ll send a follow-up email in
another 10 days. 

4.   The
prospect may contact you directly or fill out an online lead form where they
may subscribe to your newsletter or ask for a quote immediately. You will be notified
by email as soon as a quote is requested. 

 

Logistics and help

-        
You
can upload a list of your own prospects or purchase them from our list
provider, USAData. Based on extensive studies of solar customers, we’ve
filtered the information from USAData to provide names that are more likely to
turn into customers to ensure your campaigns are always cost-effective.
However, you have the option to make changes to the demographic information if
your market requires it.

-        
By
doing all of our printing, stamping, and mailing at once, we can provide you
with a great price. This campaign costs only $1.75 per record.
