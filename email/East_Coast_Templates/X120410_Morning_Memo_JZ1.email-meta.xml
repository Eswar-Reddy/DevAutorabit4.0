    <subject>Morning Memo - Satisfaction Survey &amp; Challenge</subject>
    <textOnly>Satisfaction Survey
I remember my father telling me &quot;If you don&apos;t vote, you can&apos;t complain!&quot;  Think of this as your vote!  The attached documents were sent to you on November 30th.  It is important that you take the time to fill out the survey.  SunPower wants your input so we can continue to improve.  Please take the time to find the original email and follow the link to the survey.
If you can&apos;t find the original email, let me know and I can have it sent to you again.  If you already took the time to fill out the survey, &quot;Thank you&quot;! 


 


 
Ride Along Challenge
I want to get better at understanding you, your customers and the challenges you face selling SunPower.  The goal is to allow me to see what you see.  Then work together to implement the lessons from the SunPower Advanced Residential Selling System to try to help you close more deals.
I have limited time available so I won&apos;t be able to go along with everyone so I will have to pick and choose depending on how many requests I receive.
If you want to improve, it starts with challenging yourself.  That is what I am doing!  I am challenging myself to get in front of customers so I am better able to help all of my dealers win at the kitchen table.
Are you up for it!</textOnly>
