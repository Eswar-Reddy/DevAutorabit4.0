    <subject>HomePower Magazine:  Critical Selection Criteria</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Contact.FirstName}


The December issue of HomPower Magazine, available in Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders Bookstores everywhere, included a great cover article that you should know about and reference.
 
&quot;Top 10 Selection Criteria for Solar Electric Panels.&quot;
 
hmmmm.  That might be worth having handy for in-home sales calls.
 
I have attached this article and encourage you to include it in your talk tracks, as it validates SunPower&apos;s High Efficiency story and helps the layman interpret some of the technical stuff we all take for granted.
 
Learn it.  Live it.  Love it.  (Fast times at Ridgemont High quote!)
