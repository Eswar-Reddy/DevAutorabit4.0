Fast Track Leads
We’d like to update you on some important changes that happened last week to streamline our lead management process.
Based on a successful pilot program that we ran during the
summer, we will be updating the lead process for our highest converting lead
sources to a ‘fast track’ model. In the fast track model, qualified leads
generated through our website for homeowners interested in receiving a quote
from a dealer will be passed directly on to you for appointment scheduling. We
have decided to remove our call center from this process for three main
reasons:1. Prospects are
prompted for all of the qualifying questions on our online lead form, so there is no need for our Customer Service Representatives to
call our web leads back for screening2. We’d like to
reduce the number of steps it takes for interested prospects to get in touch
with our dealers3. We know we can
count on you as the local experts to provide more detailed answers to specific
questions on rebates, financing offerings, pricing and the installation process

 

Help Us Generate the Highest Quality
Leads

The fast track lead program launched on Friday, December
17th. To coincide
with this launch we have updated the Opportunity Stages in the Partner Portal
to enable us to gather more detailed information about your initial contact
with the opportunities that we pass on to you. Our goal in making these changes
is to streamline the opportunity management process and ensure that we are
capturing data on the most critical points in the process: appointments and
closed deals. To ensure that we can effectively optimize our marketing
campaigns, it’s critical that you tell us which opportunities result in
appointments being set, and which ones become customers. With the introduction
of these new opportunity stages we ask that you update all opportunities at
these two key stages so that we get accurate and timely feedback on leads.

New Opportunity Stages

The new
Opportunity Stages are labeled as follows:

·        
Qualified Lead (default
for all new opportunities)

·        
Contacted
(please select best description after contact established)

o  
Awaiting
homeowner response 

o  
Appointment set 

o  
Lost to
competitor

o  
Bad contact
information 

o  
No longer
interested 

o  
Asked to be
contacted in the future 

·        
Purchased

 

We hope that these new stages provide a more
accurate reflection of the usual scenarios that you encounter when following-up
with SunPower leads. If you have any questions or feedback on this process
please contact Rich Austin, Customer Experience Manager, at Rich.Austin@sunpowercorp.com
or 1.800.SUNPOWER ext. 11468.

E-SeriesSelling
Have you figured out &apos;E-Series Selling&apos;?  Do you even know what E-Series stands for?
In an effort to help you stand our from all of your competitors, SunPower has started branding our products by Efficiency.  In a customer&apos;s eyes a 230w panel is a 230w panel.  When you start talking about Efficiency, you can easily separate yourself from everyone else.  If you are using the words Maximum Efficiency, High Efficiency and Standard Efficiency in your presentation you are making your hob a lot harder on yourself than you have to.
If you don&apos;t understand the difference in efficiencies, please let me know and we can set up a time to cover this.  If you think it is about our panels being smaller, you are incorrect!  This is a common misconception and if this is what you believe it to be, you are losing sales!
Let&apos;s start 2011 with as much ammunition in tool belt as possible.  Understanding E-Series and how to present them is the difference between winning and losing at the kitchen table._________________________________________________________
Thank You!
I just want to say thank you!  I know that solar is a crazy industry, but SunPower and I truly appreciate all that you do each and every day.
Please let us know how we can help!</textOnly>
