Dear {!Contact.Name},

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of your SunPower Solar Lease Agreement (hereafter referred to as “Lease”), we are pleased to inform you of your right to exercise the one-time early buyout option. This option allows you to purchase the residential solar photovoltaic system installed at {!Contact.MailingAddress} (hereafter referred to as “System”), if you are not in default of the Lease agreement. This option is a one-time option to purchase outside of the purchase options available at time of home sale or at end of lease term.

To exercise your early buyout option (EBO), you must provide notice in writing no later than 60 days before the scheduled date of the EBO. The scheduled date of EBO for lease {!Lease_Schedule_Summary__c.Lease_Number__c} is &lt;EBO Date&gt;. The purchase price for your system is &lt;EBO Amount&gt; plus applicable taxes and any amounts (including Monthly Lease Payments) due under the Lease but unpaid. An exact quote inclusive of EBO price, taxes, and amounts due but unpaid under the Lease will be provide subsequent to receiving your written request.

On the closing date for the purchase of the System pursuant to the exercise of the EBO option, we will transfer and convey the System to you on an as-is, where-is basis, and you agree to execute customary documentation to evidence such transfer and conveyance. You will be responsible for payment of any sales taxes or similar other taxes, fees or charges imposed on you or SunPower, as Lessor, by governmental authorities in connection with such a sale and purchase. SunPower will assign to you any product and/or workmanship warranties still in effect for the System.

Please send your written notice, along with the best phone number or email address to contact you, to the following address:

SunPower Capital
PO BOX 844549
Los Angeles, CA 90084-5759


Once you have received your EBO quote, you may then remit the quoted amount to the address indicated on your quote. Requesting the EBO quote does not obligate you to exercise your EBO option. If funds are not received by the EBO date, your monthly lease payments will be invoiced and your obligations under the Lease will continue.

SunPower appreciates your business and your dedication to preserving our environment through the use of clean energy. If you have any outstanding questions, please contact us at 1-800-321-1770.


Sincerely,

SunPower Leasing Customer Service</textOnly>
