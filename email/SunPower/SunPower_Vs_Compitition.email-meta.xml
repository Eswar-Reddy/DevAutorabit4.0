    <textOnly>Do you think that all solar is created equal? 

Solar technology can vary widely. SunPower holds the world record in solar efficiencyâ€”our panels generate up to 50% more power than other solar panels and up to four times more power than thin-film technology. More power cuts your electricity bill and delivers a greater return for years to come.

And if you have limited roof space, you should know that SunPower solar systems take up a fraction of the space compared with other systems, while delivering the same amount of power.</textOnly>
