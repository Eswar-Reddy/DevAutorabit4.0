    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Account},

Thank you for your interest in purchasing a SunPower System. We recently introduced you to {!Opportunity.Partner_Account_text__c} and have learned it wasn’t a good fit. We’ve reviewed our dealer network again and are sorry to report that we aren’t able to find a better match at this time.

We’re excited that you’re excited about solar, and so we will certainly keep you in the loop as our dealer network expands. Once we have established a partner that can meet your needs, we would be more than happy to offer you our industry leading products, and service you expect.

Again we thank you for your interest in SunPower and our products.

Sincerely,

1-800-SUNPOWER
