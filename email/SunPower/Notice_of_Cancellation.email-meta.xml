Contract Termination Notice


Dear {!Contact.Name},

We are writing this letter to inform you that we are cancelling the contract {!echosign_dev1__SIGN_Agreement__c.Lease_Number__c} that you entered into with SunPower on {!echosign_dev1__SIGN_Agreement__c.echosign_dev1__DateSignedDate__c} 

Our records indicate that the solar system will not be installed according to the terms of the agreement.  Please see the attached Notification of Contract Termination.  If you still wish to pursue a solar system, please contact your sales representative and arrange to execute a new agreement.

We thank you for your interest in the SunPower solar program.


Sincerely,

SunPower Financing Team</textOnly>
