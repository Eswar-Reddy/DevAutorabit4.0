    <textOnly>Dear  {!Case.Contact}, 

Thank you for choosing SunPower as your solar provider. 

We appreciate you taking the time to troubleshoot your monitoring system. I have attached a troubleshooting guide that should help you address the problem you reported. Please try to perform the troubleshooting steps within 24 hours.
 
Our technical experts will monitor your issue for the next 2 days and we will send you another email to confirm if the problem you reported is no longer an issue. If the results are unfavorable or you still can&apos;t get your monitoring system online, you will receive instructions to call our Technical Support team. The same information can also be found in the troubleshooting guide.
