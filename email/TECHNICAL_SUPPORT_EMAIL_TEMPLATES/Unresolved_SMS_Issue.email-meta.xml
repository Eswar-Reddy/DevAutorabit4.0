    <textOnly>Hi  {!Contact.FirstName}

We have a record of you calling us on &lt;date&gt; to report a monitoring issue and we asked you to perform quick troubleshooting steps to see if that would help. We noticed that your SunPower Monitoring System still isn’t reporting energy production information to our server.

Please call 1-800-786-7693, option 4 for Technical Support, so that we may assist you. We’re here for you Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. PST. Alternatively, you may also reply to this email within five (5) business days if you still need help or require more information, otherwise your case will be closed.
