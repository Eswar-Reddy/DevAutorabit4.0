    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Thank you for your interest in SunPower.

Please let me know if our Partner has reached out to you and address your solar enquiry to your satisfaction. Kindly confirm by replying to this email or by calling me at 1-800 SunPower (1800 786 769). I am available from Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm (AWST).
