    <subject>SunPower X-series Enquiry - {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in SunPower products.

Currently SunPower Australia supplies the E-Series 327Watt solar panel, which is rated at 20.4% efficiency and is backed by a 25-year power and product warranty.

The recently launched X-Series 345Watt solar panel has proved extremely popular, but unfortunately due to high demand and limited production these are only available in a small number of countries, excluding Australia.

For your reference I have attached a copy of our E-Series product and warranty data sheets.

Would you like to be connected with one of our local Authorised Partners, who could offer you a quote for SunPower E-Series panels?

Regards,
{!Contact.OwnerFullName}| Customer Service Representative - Australia
