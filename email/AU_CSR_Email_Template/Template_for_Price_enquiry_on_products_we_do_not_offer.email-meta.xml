    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in SunPower products.

We understand your interest in the SunPower X-Series 345Watt solar panels, but unfortunately due to high demand and limited production these are only available in a small number of countries, excluding Australia.

SunPower Australia is responsible for importing and distributing all SunPower product and there is currently no option to import the X-Series solar panels into Australia.

Unfortunately at this time we cannot assist you with your original request, but we can connect you with one of our local Authorised Partners, who could offer you a quote for SunPower E-Series panels?

Regards,
{!Contact.OwnerFullName} | Customer Service Representative - Australia
