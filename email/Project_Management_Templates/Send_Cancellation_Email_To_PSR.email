Hello PSR Team,<br/><br/>
{!LeasePayment__c.PSR__c}<br/><br/>
Due to a pending contract cancellation, Salesforce attempted to place a material shipment hold in Oracle for contract {!LeasePayment__c.Lease__c}. The Salesforce call to Oracle was unsuccessful. Consequently, the order was not placed on hold. Please go to Oracle and manually place this order on hold.

Thank you,<br/>
