    <subject>Contract # {!LeasePayment__c.Lease__c} - Hold or Cancellation.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello PSR Team,

Due to a pending contract cancellation, Salesforce attempted to place a material shipment hold in Oracle for contract {!LeasePayment__c.Lease__c}. The Salesforce call to Oracle was unsuccessful. Consequently, the order was not placed on hold. Please go to Oracle and manually place this order on hold.

Thank you,
SunPower Digital Team</textOnly>
