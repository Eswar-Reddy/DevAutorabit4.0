    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope this email finds you well.

It shows in our records that property located at {!LeasePayment__c.Site_Street__c}, {!LeasePayment__c.Site_City__c}, {!LeasePayment__c.Site_State_Prov__c} {!LeasePayment__c.Site_Zip_PostCode__c} have an active approved loan with Enerbank (Application No. xxxxxxxxxx) and approved SunPower Lease (Lease {!LeasePayment_c.Lease_c}). Is this correct? If Yes, we would like to advise you that SunPower do not recommend two active financing options. Thus, you need to choose one to go solar.

Please advise if you will proceed with your Enerbank loan to purchase the solar system, or you will proceed to lease the system with SunPower.

To cancel your Same-as-Cash loan, please contact Enerbank directly at 888-724-3552.
To cancel your SunPower Lease, please send an email to sunpowerleasing@sunpower.com.

Feel free to contact us should you have questions and concerns.

Thank you very much!


Respectfully,


Customer Financing Team - Enerbank</textOnly>
