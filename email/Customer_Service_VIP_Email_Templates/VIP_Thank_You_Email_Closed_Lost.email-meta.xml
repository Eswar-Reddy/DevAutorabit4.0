    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Referrer_ID__c}
 
We would like to thank you for referring {!Opportunity.Name} to SunPower. We would like to inform you that {!Opportunity.Name} no longer wants to pursue his interest in acquiring a SunPower system.
 
Per our conversation with (Dealer Contact) from (Dealer Name), (VIP Last name) (state reason lost, ex: doesn&apos;t feel that solar will be cost effective at the moment).
 
Please note that his/her contact information will be kept in the database for future references. The RLC team appreciates your referral and we would be more than happy to assist any future referrals.
 
Thank you again for the VIP lead.
