Good day!

I am contacting you on behalf of {!Lead.Referrer_ID__c}, who expressed your interest in solar for your home.
 
Please let me know your most convenient time to further discuss your interest, and answer any questions that you may have. Also during our conversation I would like to facilitate an introduction to your SunPower Dealer, local to your area.
 
I truly appreciate your interest in our products. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
