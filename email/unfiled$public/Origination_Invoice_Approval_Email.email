Your Origination Invoice has been approved for Lease Payment {!LeasePayment__c.Name}. {!LeasePayment__c.Link}
 
Just some reminders: 
- Installation invoice should reflect only the Installation fee (60%) since Origination fee has already been approved for payment 
- Unique invoice number should be used 
- For payment not received 30 days after you receive approval notification, please feel free to contact Accounts Payable at APHelpDesk@sunpower.com, indicating the PO # and invoice #. 

Thank you,
