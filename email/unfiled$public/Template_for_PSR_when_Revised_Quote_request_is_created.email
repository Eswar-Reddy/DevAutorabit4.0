<font face="Courier New" size=3>Dear {!Quote_Summary__c.Primary_PSR__c},<br/><br/>

 {!Quote_Summary__c.Dealer_Account__c} has requested a revision for Lease {!Quote_Summary__c.Old_Lease_Number__c}, any further processing for this lease should be stopped. If Oracle Order has been created, it should be put on hold.  <br/><br/>

Once the revised lease document is executed, you will be receiving a separate notification to begin processing of the new order and terminate the existing order.<br/><br/>
  Regards<br/>
  Lease Team</font><br/>
