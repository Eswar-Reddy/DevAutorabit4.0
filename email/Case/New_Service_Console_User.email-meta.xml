    <textOnly>Hello,

You now have access to Service Console, the Salesforce.com User Interface designed specifically for people who support Customers and Partners. It has a number of features that will make your job easier and faster.

To help you take advantage of the new features quickly, this message tells you:

What to do now
An overview of the changes
How to get training or help


What you need to do now:

Please log out of Salesforce at your next break. When you log back in, you’ll be in Service Console.

In the future, to move in and out of Service Console, use the blue oval drop-down at the top right of your Salesforce screen.


Here is an overview of the changes:

Service Console provides:

The ability to have multiple records open within Salesforce, and easily jump between them.
A ‘Partner Portal Button’ that opens the Partner Portal in a separate browser tab, so you can quickly go back and forth between Salesforce and the Portal.
A Notepad built into Salesforce that attaches your notes directly to the new or existing case you are working on.
Links to all the systems you use frequently, like SMS.
The Knowledge Base, with articles written by CSR’s, PSR’s and TSE’s on the most-queried topics, including automatic look-up based on the Subject of the Case. And with one click, you can attach the article to the Case.


Training Video:

There’s a video of the WebEx training session at:

https://sunpower.webex.com/sunpower/lsr.php?RCID=2ece96ef3a144f408ad2307c94b659b0

Note:  For the first 3-4 minutes there’s no sound or video, but then it will start automatically.

How to get help:

If you need help with the new software, spot a problem or have a suggestion, use the same support channel you always use: Create a CRM case or send an e-mail to CRM@Sunpower.com.


We hope you find that the Service Console makes it easier to do your work, and we look forward to your feedback and suggestions.
