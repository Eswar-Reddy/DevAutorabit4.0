    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:


Your partner application to work with SunPower has been approved. The next step in the process will be to execute an agreement. We use an online signature technology - EchoSign - that complies with all legal standards and attaches a digital signature to secure electronic documents. The document is password protected; we will contact you separately with this information. Please look for a message from EchoSign in the next few moments.


Please review the terms and conditions of the agreement, paying particular attention to the representation of your company name on the signature page. Reseller, alliance and participation agreements with SunPower should include your official company name, as represented in your terms of incorporation. After we receive your response, a fully executed copy will be returned to you for good standing order of your files.


We have created a document that you can use to track your progress through our Partner On boarding process and would appreciate your feedback as you engage with us over the next few weeks. The document is attached.


Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you for years to come.
