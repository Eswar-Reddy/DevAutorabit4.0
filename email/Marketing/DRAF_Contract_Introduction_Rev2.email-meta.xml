    <subject>SunPower | {!Account.Name} Dealer Refer-A-Friend Participation Agreement</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:

Thank you for electing to participate in the SunPower Dealer Refer-a-Friend Program!



The next step in the process will be to execute an agreement. We use an online signature technology - EchoSign - that complies with all legal standards and attaches a digital signature to secure electronic documents. The document is password protected; we will contact you separately with this information. Please look for a message from EchoSign in the next few moments.



Once you have signed the agreement, we will send you an email containing your vanity URL  and tools that you can use to promote your referral program on your website, in emails via social media.


Thank you again for your participation.


Sincerely,



The SunPower Marketing Team</textOnly>
