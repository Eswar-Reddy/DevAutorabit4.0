Hi All,

Good day!

Attached are the documents you will need to process the Assignment of this Lease. One (usually escrow) will be responsible for routing the documents for signature which can be done during closing.

1. Escrow Package: (2 part document) Escrow Instructions and Assignment of Lease. Note this can be signed electronically.
2. UCC termination fixture document: Note that no one needs to sign this document.
3. A draft of the Extinguishment of the Notice of Independent Solar Producer: To set your expectations, we have sent this to our notary in Austin TX for notarization. Thank you for having the shipping label readily available ({!Case.Shipper_Tracking_Number__c}). Please expect the original copy to be delivered in 2 to 3 business days and note that the original copy needs to be filed with the title.

Once the Escrow Instructions and Assignment documents are signed and completed, please mail it with the final payment requested in the Escrow Instructions to the address below.
