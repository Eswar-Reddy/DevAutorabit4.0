    <textOnly>Hi All,

Good day!

To give you an update, our Credit Team was able to successfully send the credit check application link to the buyer last _______. It was sent to _______ (buyer&apos;s email address indicated in the homesale form).

The current credit check status is still Pending-Application sent. This means that the buyer has not clicked on the credit check application link in the email yet.

Kindly help us follow up with the buyer so we can get the process going as soon as they pass the credit check.

Please have them check the junk or spam folders for this email which will come from: no-reply@credit.sunpowercorp.com. You may refer to the Credit Check Guidelines email that was previously sent.

Should there be any concerns or queries, kindly use this email thread in order for us to locate the emails faster and respond accordingly.


Thank you!
