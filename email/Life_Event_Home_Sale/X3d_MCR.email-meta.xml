    <subject>Case# {!Case.CaseNumber}: Your Credit Check with SunPower is Declined - Lease# {!Case.Lease__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Buyer,

We are sorry to hear that the Credit Check Application came back as declined. Let us move forward with our Manual Credit Review so we can proceed with the lease assignment.

Below are the requirements:

2 latest paycheck stubs
Income Tax Return (most recent)
Mortgage loan approval or pre-approval letter (if applicable)
Bank statement

Please email us the scanned copy of these so we may have them reviewed by our Credit Manager. Note that this may take 2-3 business days from receipt of the requirements. Rest assured we will expedite this if possible.

Should there be any concerns or queries, kindly use this email thread in order for us to locate the emails faster and respond accordingly.


Thank you!
