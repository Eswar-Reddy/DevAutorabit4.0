    <textOnly>Hi All,

We are happy to let you know that the buyer&apos;s credit check has been approved. Congratulations!

Kindly send us a copy of the preliminary title report so we can obtain the lien recorded docs information. Once received, we can then proceed to the next step: Termination of the lien recorded documents and actual document creation.

For California states, kindly send us a shipping label as well so we can overnight the notarized Extinguishment of the Solar Contract.

Should there be any concerns or queries, kindly use this email thread in order for us to locate the emails faster and respond accordingly.


Thank you!
