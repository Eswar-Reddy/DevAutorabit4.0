    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

We are sorry we haven’t been able to connect this week.  We understand you may be busy, but we want to share with you the link to SunPower&apos;s community page, so you can explore our customer’s testimonials. These are the stories of real families sharing how solar has improved their lives.

We are here to help you take the next steps to solar power when you are ready!  All we need to do is discuss your home and schedule a free, no-obligation appointment with one of our knowledgeable solar professionals.

To schedule this appointment, please give us a call or reply to this email with a couple of times that would work for you.  We will ask a few questions about your home, schedule the appointment and send you a confirmation email with the details.

Thanks again for your interest! Hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Your Solar Advisor Team
