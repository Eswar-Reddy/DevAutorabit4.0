    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I&apos;m with SunPower®, following up on my voicemail about your recent solar power inquiry. I’m sorry to have missed you. {!Lead.Referrer_ID__c} provided us with your contact information as someone who might be interested in solar. As I mentioned in my message, I’d like to connect you with an energy consultant who can help you find the SunPower® solar system that is right for your home.

During a free, no-obligation appointment, a courteous and knowledgeable solar professional will answer all of your questions. The typical appointment takes place in your home and lasts about an hour. You and your energy consultant can assess your available roof space to determine the best installation spots, discuss your needs, and review your options.

To set up the appointment, please call me at the phone number below or simply reply to this email with a couple of times that would work best for you. I’ll schedule the appointment and send a confirmation to summarize the details.

Thanks again for your interest in SunPower! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Your Solar Advisor Team
