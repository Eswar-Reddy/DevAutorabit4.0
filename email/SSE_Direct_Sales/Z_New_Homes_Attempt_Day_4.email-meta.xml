    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I am following up on my voicemail message left earlier regarding the scheduling of your SunPower solar energy consultation. As your builder’s solar provider, we want to ensure that you have been provided with the options available to start saving on your monthly bills as soon as you move in!

As I mentioned in my message, the next step is to schedule you for a quick 15 minute phone call with our Energy Consultants who will answer any questions and help you choose the SunPower® solar system that is right for your home.

To schedule an appointment, just give me a call or reply to this email with a few times that work for you. I’ll schedule the appointment and send you a confirmation email with the details.

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Warmly,
Your Solar Advisor Team
