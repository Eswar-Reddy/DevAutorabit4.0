    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Congratulations on the purchase of your new home! As your builder&apos;s solar provider, SunPower offers immediate ways to lower your electric bill.

A solar advisor called you today. Within the coming days, SunPower will contact you to help you understand how solar works and saves you money.
