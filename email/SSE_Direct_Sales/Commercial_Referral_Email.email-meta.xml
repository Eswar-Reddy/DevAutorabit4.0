    <subject>SunPower Commercial Solar Inquiry</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I&apos;m with SunPower®, following up about your recent solar power inquiry. I’m sorry to have missed you.

{!Lead.Referred_By__c} provided us with your contact information as someone who might be interested in solar energy for your business. We&apos;d like to help you reach your goals by connecting you with a team who can help find the SunPower® solar system that is right for your business.


You then can discuss the available roof space or surrounding land to determine the best installation spots, discuss a custom proposal, and review your options.


Please call us at the phone number below or simply reply to this email. We will ask a few questions about your business and based on our discussion forward that information to the correct team.


Thanks again for your interest in SunPower! We look forward to hearing from you soon.


Many Thanks,

Your Solar Advisor Team
