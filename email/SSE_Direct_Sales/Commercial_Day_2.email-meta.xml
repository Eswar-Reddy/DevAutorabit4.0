    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.Name},

I’m sorry we haven’t been able to connect. We understand that you are busy and we’re here to make your solar research quick and easy.

The first step toward discovering how much your organization can save from solar is a brief conversation with one of our Solar Advisors. We’ll simply review a few key criteria to help determine if solar is a fit for you.

To speak with someone immediately, please call 1-844-289-7970. Or simply reply to this email to schedule a convenient time to talk. Our conversation will only take about 10 minutes.

In the meantime, get more information about solar technology from SunPower.

Sincerely,

Your SunPower Team
