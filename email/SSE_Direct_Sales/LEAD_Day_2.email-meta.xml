    <subject>Setting Up Your Solar Power Consultation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},


Are you ready to start saving on electricity by going solar? We are here to help you take the next step and get set up with a solar energy consultant who can help find the SunPower© solar system that’s right for you!


It’s a free, no-obligation appointment in your home with a knowledgeable solar professional. During this time, you’ll be able to ask all of your questions, discuss your needs, and review your options.


To set up the appointment, please give us a call or reply to this email with a couple of times that would work best for you. We will ask a couple questions about your home, schedule the appointment and send a confirmation to summarize the details.


Thanks again for your interest in SunPower©! We look forward to hearing back from you soon.


Sincerely,

Your Solar Advisor Team
