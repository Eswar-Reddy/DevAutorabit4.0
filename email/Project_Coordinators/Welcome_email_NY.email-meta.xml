    <subject>Welcome to SunPower!</subject>
    <textOnly>Welcome to the SunPower® family! We look forward to providing your home with clean, renewable energy in the years ahead.

I want to introduce myself and tell you about the solar installation process and what to expect next.  I will be your point of contact during your installation and my primary goals are to keep you informed and answer any questions during the project. Here’s an overview of the steps in the installation process and what to expect at each milestone:

Contract Signed

You are here. Within a week our SunPower Installation Partner will be reaching out to you to schedule time for a technical Site Audit.

Site Audit

At the Site Audit, our SunPower Installation Partner will visit your home to assess the roof, take measurements, evaluate shading, look at the main service electric panel and determine optimal locations for the solar equipment.  This visit takes about an hour and it is recommended you are present as  to your garage and attic is required

Design Review

Approximately 2-3 weeks after the Site Audit, you will receive a detailed design layout document to review and approve. It will include the specifications that SunPower works from to install your system.   I will be available if you have any questions or need clarification on the layout. Once you have approved the design, I will provide you with the necessary documents for you to submit to your homeowner’s association (HOA) if applicable.

Permitting

Once the design for your system is approved, we will obtain the appropriate construction permits from your local jurisdiction.   Depending on your local jurisdiction’s permitting process, this can take a few weeks.

Installation

Our SunPower Installation Partner will reach out to you directly to set a time that works for you and let you know more details about what to expect on the day(s) of your solar installation.

Inspection

When the installation is finished, SunPower will arrange for the necessary inspections from your local jurisdiction, and/or your utility provider. These inspections are typically completed within one week of the installation of your system.

Permission to Operate (PTO)

We will make the necessary arrangements with your utility to grant PTO your system.  Utility timelines vary, but this typically takes 3-4 weeks following the inspection.

System Activation

Once your utility grants PTO, your system is ready to be activated. To make sure you have everything you need and are familiar with the operation of your system, your Energy Consultant, {INSERT EC NAME} will come out and do a system walkthrough with you.

I will be keeping track of the progress of the installation and reaching out to you regularly throughout.  While every solar project is different, the time from signing your contract until the system is producing energy takes approximately 3 months.

What Happens Now?

The next steps will be contact from our SunPower Installation Partner to schedule the site audit and to confirm with me if your neighborhood has a Homeowner&apos;s Association (HOA).  If so, now is the time to reach out to get information regarding the approval process for solar system installations in your neighborhood. I will provide you with the necessary documents for you to submit.

If you have any questions throughout the installation process, please reach out to me directly.  

Thank you again for choosing SunPower and I look forward to working with you.  Have a great day!</textOnly>
