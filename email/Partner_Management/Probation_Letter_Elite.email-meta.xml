Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your business.  We know that the solar market is competitive and we appreciate the work you do to sell SunPower products.  We also recognize the time and energy that you invest in our business relationship and that is one of the reasons that we have rigorous standards for training, customer satisfaction, and co-marketing. Those standards help protect your investment to maintain your SunPower Dealer status and ensure that it remains a significant access.

This letter is to inform you that our data for 1st half of 2017 shows that {!Account.Name} did not meet the {!Account.Dealer_Tier__c} Partner Residential Dealer Requirements detailed in the SunPower Dealer Agreement.

While the Dealer Program Funds (DPF) 1st half period (1H 2017) for {!Account.Name} will not be disbursed at this time, you do still have the opportunity to receive those funds by meeting the requirements that were missed in the 1H 2017 period. You have until September 29, 2017 to do so, and please contact your Regional Sales Manager if there is a reason that timeline is not feasible.

The program requirements that our records show {!Account.Name} missed are:

·         Requirements here




If you are unable to regain the requirements to remain in your dealer tier, you may be demoted to a lower tier and may not receive your 1H 2017 DPF. If you are demoted, you have the chance to earn DPF at your new tier level for the 2nd half of 2017.

Please note: SunPower will automatically update the training certification status and the volume of your shipped orders at the end of each month, but please contact Channel.Development@sunpowercorp.com and your RSM to update your co-branding metrics.

Again, thank you very much for your business and we look forward to continue working with you to change the way our world is powered!
Sincerely,

SunPower&apos;s Residential Channel Development Team</textOnly>
