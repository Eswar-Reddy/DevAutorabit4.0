Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


As described in our email last August, {!Account.Name} failed to achieve the Premier Dealer requirements detailed in the SunPower Dealer Agreement between {!Account.Name} and SunPower (the “Dealer Agreement”) during the first half of 2016.


In accordance with the Dealer Agreement and the Dealer Guidelines, if a Dealer is unable to regain and complete the current requirements for the Premier tier by the next evaluation date, the Dealer:

Will be demoted to the Authorized Tier
Will be paid bonuses they are eligible for in the first half of 2016 at the Authorized Tier level. (This means a maximum of 0.5% of your qualified revenue instead of full 3% bonus option at the Premier Tier)

The program requirements that {!Account.Name} missed is/are (requirements here)



As of this notification your status has been changed to Authorized.  At this point, you may not promote yourself nor use any co-branding material including Websites, Apparel, or other methods to promote yourselves as a SunPower Premier Dealer. You may promote yourself as a SunPower Authorized Dealer as long as you complete the current Authorized Tier requirements detailed in the Dealer Agreement.


{!Account.Name} is also no longer eligible for the Premier Dealer Bonus; however, you will be eligible for the SunPower Authorized Dealer Bonus of 0.5% of your eligible revenue in the second half of 2016.


Please also note that {!Account.Name}’s payment terms now revert to the Authorized Tier of Net 45 days.


SunPower does value this relationship and you can work to get promoted back to the Premier Tier status if you can meet the minimum requirements again by the first half of 2017. We look forward to continuing to work with you to help you grow your business. Should you need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact your Regional Sales Manager.


Sincerely,


Katherine Arnaud
