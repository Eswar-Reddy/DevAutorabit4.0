Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your business.  We know that the solar market is competitive and we appreciate the work you do to sell SunPower products.  We also recognize the time and energy that you invest in our business relationship and that is one of the reasons that we have rigorous standards for training, customer satisfaction, and co-marketing. Those standards help protect your investment to maintain your SunPower Dealer status and ensure that it remains a significant asset.



This letter is to inform you that our data for 1st half of 2017 shows that {!Account.Name} did not meet the {!Account.Dealer_Tier__c} Partner Residential Dealer Requirements detailed in the SunPower Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer Program Funds (DPF) for the 2017 1st half period (1H 2017) for {!Account.Name} will not be disbursed at this time. You will need to correct those requirements that were missed and have until September 29, 2017 to do so. Please contact your Regional Sales Manager if there is a reason that this timeline is not feasible.

The program requirements that our records show {!Account.Name} missed are:





If you can correct the missed requirements by September 29, 2017 and you achieved your kW growth Target that was set for the 1H 2017, then you will receive your eligible DPF funds.



If you are unable to correct the requirements to remain in your dealer tier, you will not receive the 1H 2017 DPF and your SunPower dealer agreement could be cancelled.


Please note: SunPower will automatically update the training certification status and customer satisfaction account metrics at the end of each month, but please contact Channel.Development@sunpowercorp.com and your RSM to update co-branding metrics.

Again, thank you very much for your business and we look forward to continue working with you to change the way the world is powered!
Sincerely,

SunPower&apos;s Residential Channel Development Team</textOnly>
