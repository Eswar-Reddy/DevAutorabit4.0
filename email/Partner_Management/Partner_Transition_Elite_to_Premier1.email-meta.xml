We want your investment to maintain your SunPower Dealer status to be protected and a significant asset.

Due to the missed requirements, your status will be changed to Authorized Partner on {date 5 days from date of this email}. At that time, you should not continue to promote yourself as a SunPower Elite Dealer.  Please also note that your payment terms now revert to the Authorized Partner Tier of Net 45 days.


SunPower values your business and we look forward to continuing to work with you to help you grow your business.
