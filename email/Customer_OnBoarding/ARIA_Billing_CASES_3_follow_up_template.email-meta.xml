    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.Name},

This is to follow-up on the previous email I&apos;ve sent. Since I haven&apos;t receive a response from you, I would now be closing the ticket I&apos;ve created for your inquiry - CASE #: {!Case.CaseNumber}. You&apos;d be receiving a brief survey in your email, and I&apos;d appreciate if you could take time to answer and let us know how you think I&apos;ve been of service to you.

We value your business with SunPower. Feel free to contact us via the channels below. Have a great day!
