    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Account},


Thank you for choosing SunPower as your energy service provider.


We recognize the importance of building a strong partnership with our customers over the years ahead. With this, we are hoping to initiate a brief conversation with you through a welcome call so we can ensure you have a good understanding of the lease agreement that you signed through our partner {!Case.Partner_Account__c}.


I tried to reach you at &lt;customer’s phone number&gt; and left you a voicemail. Is there a best time to call you? You can also reach me at the numbers below or simply reply to this email.


Thank you for joining us in this journey to change the way our world is powered!
