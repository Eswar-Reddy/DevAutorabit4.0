    <textOnly>Good day!

Automatic debit option is a convenient way to pay your SunPower monthly lease for account number _____ as it will ensure hassle free on-time payment processing. You will also get a monthly ACH discount of $7.50 from your monthly lease.

We understand that you initially signed up for automatic debit with your dealer upon completion of your lease document. However, due to technical glitch, the system did not capture your ach details hence, the account was not enrolled to automatic debit. Please fill out this automatic debit form and send it back to us for enrollment.

You may send it via email at booking@sunpower.com or mail on the address below:

PO BOX 844549
Los Angeles, CA 90084


You may also choose to include a copy of your voided check upon returning the accomplished form.

Thank you for helping SunPower change the way our world is powered.
