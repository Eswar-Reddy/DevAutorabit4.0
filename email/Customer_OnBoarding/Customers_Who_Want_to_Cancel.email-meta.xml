    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.Account},


I wrote to touch base with you regarding our previous conversation when you expressed your intention to cancel the lease agreement.


We greatly want to be the provider of your solar needs in the next 20 years. However, if you still want to pursue with the cancellation, you may send us an email notification at sunpowerleasing@sunpower.com. Please note that cancellation requests are subject for SunPower’s review and approval.


Your dealer is also copied in this email. For questions, you may also reach them at &lt;dealer’s phone number&gt;.


Please feel free to contact us at 1-800-783-7693 for any details regarding the lease agreement.
