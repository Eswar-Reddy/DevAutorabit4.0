    <textOnly>Hello  {!Case.Account} ,


I appreciate the time you spent to take my call. It was a pleasure speaking with you today.


To recap our conversation, I am sending you below information about the lease agreement you’ve signed through our partner &lt;name of dealer&gt; which I hope you find useful.


Ø Billing


- Your monthly payments will be due on the 1st of every month and will start after the first full month after your energy start date. &lt;modify accordingly if the customer is enrolled in ACH or otherwise&gt;



Ø Production Guarantee


- SunPower includes a Production Guarantee in your lease contract, ensuring that your system will produce within an expected range of energy output each year. After 12 months, you will receive a personalized statement outlining your system’s energy production for the previous year.  If the system produces below the estimated range, SunPower will send you a check for the calculated shortfall. Again the basic requirement that we have for the Production Guarantee to take effect is an established internet connection.


Ø SunPower Monitoring System


- This is an easy-to-use web-based interface that lets you keep track of the solar energy your system produces and compare your solar energy output over hours, days, months, and years.  You can watch your solar power system in action and ensure it is performing optimally. In addition, you will want to be sure and maintain the internet connection so that our hardware can transmit information about the system’s electricity production.


For questions, please feel free to call me at 1-800-786-7693, or simply reply to this email.


Welcome again to SunPower!
