    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your interest in purchasing a SunPower System using the (Partner Name) Solar Program. Unfortunately, at this time, we do not have a participating SunPower Dealer servicing your area.


We apologize that SunPower is not in your area yet. However, we are continuing to expand our Dealer coverage area on a regular basis. Once we have established service in your area, we would be more than happy to offer you our industry leading products, and service you expect.


Again we thank you for your interest in SunPower and our products.


Sincerely,


(ACSR)

Alliance Team
