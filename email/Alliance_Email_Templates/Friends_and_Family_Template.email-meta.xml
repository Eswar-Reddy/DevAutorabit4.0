    <textOnly>Hi {!Opportunity.Name},


{!Opportunity.Referred_By_First_Name__c} sent us a note that you are interested in getting a solar system for your home. We would like to refer you to a SunPower dealer in your area.


As a friend of {!Opportunity.Referred_By_First_Name__c} {!Opportunity.Referred_By_Last_Name__c}, you are entitled to get a $.60/watt DC rebate with a maximum of $3,000 on a purchase of solar electric system or a flat $500 with a lease.


Kindly provide us your complete address and your phone number to help us determine the best dealer in your area. Once weâ€™ve assigned a dealer, they will call you to set up a solar evaluation.


Thanks.
