Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


SunPower’s records show that we have not received either complete installation invoice packages or unconditional final lien waiver documents for the leases listed below within the timeframes specified in the Lease Dealer Participation Agreement. These documents allow SunPower to present leases to our third party financiers, which in turn allow us to provide Notices to Proceed and to process your dealer fees in as timely a manner as possible. On {date of original invoice non- compliance communication}, we let you know that you had leases that were out of compliance with the lease invoice submission requirements, and, because our records show that is still the case, we are placing a hold on one invoice or 10% of next week’s invoice amount, whichever is greater, until we receive the complete documentation. Invoice payment hold is definitely not the outcome we or you want, so please let us know if you need any help from SunPower to get the documentation submitted.

Actions Needed by You – Installation Invoice



Please use the dealer portal to submit installation invoice packages. The customer record displays the invoice documents that have already been submitted as well as the documents that are still required for each of the leases listed above to receive payment. You can also access a report titled, “Incomplete Invoice Uploads”, which is available in the reports section of the dealer portal and provides real time updates to this information.


For a refresher on the invoice submission process, please see the online training module “Residential Lease Invoice Submission Process”.



Actions Needed by You – Unconditional Final Lien Waiver



Unconditional final lien waivers for leases that were created after 1/29/2013 have been sent by echosign. Unconditional final lien waivers for leases that were created before 1/29/2013 can be submitted directly to SunPowerLeasing@sunpowercorp.com.



If you have any questions regarding the above, please contact leasepaymentinquiry@sunpowercorp.com@sunpowercorp.com, or your SunPower Sales Manager.
Sincerely,

The SunPower Lease Team</textOnly>
