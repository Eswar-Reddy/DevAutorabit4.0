Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


SunPower’s records show that we have not received all necessary documentation for some of your leases within the timeframes specified in the Lease Dealer Participation Agreement.  These documents are important, as they ensure you receive your payments timely, and allow SunPower to present leases to our third party financiers in order to provide Notices to Proceed in a timely manner.


As a reminder, Dealers are required to:


Submit Stage 1 (Origination &amp; Installation) documentation within 30 calendar days from SunPower’s delivery of all installation materials.
Submit Stage 2 (Interconnection Submittals) documentation within 14 calendar days of the applicable utility provider issuing its PTO notice
Submit Stage 3 (Unconditional Final Lien Waivers) within 14 calendar days of receipt of the Interconnection Completion Payment from SunPower



Leases out of compliance with the DPA Exhibit D, as of (DATE), can be found in the Lease Timeline Tool.


In order to navigate the Lease Timeline Tool, please refer to the online training using below link. Make sure to log-in first in the Partner Portal.

If there were issues being encountered that delays the submission of the required documentations, please provide so.



For a refresher on the invoice submission process, please see the online training module “Residential Lease Invoice Submission Process”.


If you have any questions regarding the above, please contact leasepaymentinquiry@sunpowercorp.com or your SunPower Sales Manager.




Sincerely,

The SunPower Lease Team</textOnly>
