Dear Lender:


SunPower Corporation (“SunPower”) has been recently notified that the homeowner(s) for the above referenced property are seeking to refinance their home. SunPower has also been informed that you are requesting that SunPower provide a termination notice relative to the Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract which currently exists for the above referenced property relative to the SunPower solar system (“System”) located on the property. Please be advised that it is SunPower’s position that it cannot provide the termination notice you are requesting since said action would be in violation of Sections 2868-2869 of the California Public Utility Code.


As you may be aware, pursuant to Sections 2868-2869 SunPower is required by statute to file this notice. More importantly, Section 2869(c)(1) specifically states that, “The recorded Notice of an Independent Solar Energy Producer Contract does not constitute a title defect, lien, or encumbrance against the real property, and the independent solar energy producer shall be solely responsible for the accuracy of the information provided in the notice and for recording the document with the county recorder.”


Additionally, Section 2869(g) states that, “Any person who willfully or negligently violates or fails to perform any duty prescribed by any provision of this article shall be civilly liable in the amount of actual damages suffered by a transferee or transferor of the real property as a consequence of that violation or failure.” In light of the fact that the Notice is required by law and is not viewed as an encumbrance to a home refinance, SunPower is not willing to provide you the termination request you seek. More importantly, SunPower does not wish to expose itself to any form of civil liability which your current request for termination would create.


With that said, SunPower would still like to assist the homeowner(s) with regard to their desire to refinance their home through your company. Accordingly, SunPower is willing to offer a subordination of the notice. SunPower has utilized this approach for various other lenders without any issue or concern. Should you wish to proceed with this approach, please contact me directly so that arrangements can be made.


We hope this assists you with regard to the refinancing of the above mentioned property. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding what is contained in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact the home sale team. They can be reached at homesale@sunpower.com Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (CST).


Respectfully,

Melissa Anderson
