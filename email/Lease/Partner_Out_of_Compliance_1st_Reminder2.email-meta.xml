Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As communicated last week, SunPower’s records show that we have not received either complete installation invoice packages or unconditional final lien waiver documents for the leases listed below within the timeframes specified in the Lease Dealer Participation Agreement. These documents allow SunPower to present leases to our third party financiers, which in turn allow us to provide Notices to Proceed in as timely a manner as possible, so it is in all of our interests to get this sorted out. While we may need to hold lease payments to you if the documentation isn’t provided, we would like to resolve this issue before that step is taken, so please let us know if you have any questions. Please note that, if invoice payments are put on hold, it can take up to 10 business days to reinstate payments. Again, that is not the outcome we are looking for, but we want to make sure there are no surprises if that happens.

Actions Needed by You – Installation Invoice



Please use the dealer portal to submit installation invoice packages. The customer record displays the invoice documents that have already been submitted as well as the documents that are still required for each of the leases listed above to receive payment. You can also access a report titled, “Incomplete Invoice Uploads”, which is available in the reports section of the dealer portal and provides real time updates to this information.




For a refresher on the invoice submission process, please see the online training module “Residential Lease Invoice Submission Process”.



Actions Needed by You – Unconditional Final Lien Waiver



Unconditional final lien waivers for leases that were created after 1/29/2013 have been sent by echosign. Unconditional final lien waivers for leases that were created before 1/29/2013 can be submitted directly to SunPowerLeasing@sunpowercorp.com.



If you have any questions regarding the above, please contact leasepaymentinquiry@sunpowercorp.com@sunpowercorp.com, or your SunPower Sales Manager.
Sincerely,

The SunPower Lease Team</textOnly>
