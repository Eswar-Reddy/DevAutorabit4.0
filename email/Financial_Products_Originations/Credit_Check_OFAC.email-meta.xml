    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We were alerted by the bureau that the above mentioned customer has a namesake with Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

To further review and to confirm he does not belong to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, we need to obtain his driverâ€™s license or a copy of his passport.

Please send it at your convenience.

Thank you.


Regards,

SunPower Team</textOnly>
