RE: Lease Termination Notice – No Installation

Dear {!Account.Name},

We are writing this letter to inform you that we are cancelling the lease agreement  {!LeasePayment__c.Lease__c} that you entered into with SunPower on {!LeasePayment__c.Docs_Gen_Date__c}.

Our records indicate that the solar system will not be installed within the required installation period according to the terms of the lease agreement.  Please see the attached Notification of Lease Termination.  If you still wish to pursue a solar system, please contact your dealer and arrange to execute a new lease agreement.


We thank you for your interest in the SunPower solar lease program.

Sincerely,

SunPower Financing</textOnly>
