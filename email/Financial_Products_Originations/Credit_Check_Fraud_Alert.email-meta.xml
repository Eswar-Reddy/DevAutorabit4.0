    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and upon checking, this HO&apos;s credit report has discrepancy between the credit application and the bureau that we need to review.

With this, we would like to get a copy of his driverâ€™s license and utility bill for identity verification.

Kindly send it to us at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Regards,
SunPower Team</textOnly>
