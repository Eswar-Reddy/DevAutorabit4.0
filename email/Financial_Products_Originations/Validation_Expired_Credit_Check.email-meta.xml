Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of validating the lease contract for the above home owner, however we noticed that the credit check was already expired. It expired last ___ . Please be reminded that the validity of the credit check is only 90 days.


For us to move forward with this lease, kindly create a new business account for customer and send a link for another credit check application. No need to copy the quote and generate a new lease. We&apos;ll put the current lease on hold until new credit application has been approved.

Please advise once the homeowner got approved so we can proceed countersigning this lease.

Let us know if you have further questions.

Thank you &amp; Regards,
