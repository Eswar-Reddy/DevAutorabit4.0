Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of verifying the Property Address of the above lease agreement. Based from our Title search and address verification report, we found no records of the address:
{!Account.BillingAddress}

Please be advised that we do Title Searching as a pre â€“ countersignature requirement to ensure that the Address where the property is located at is valid and accurate, so we can avoid problem/s dealing with Public Utilities Commission (PUC) &amp; Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Filing.

We request you to send us a copy of Notarized / County recorded Deed that would reflect the property ownership of the customer.

Should you have further questions, please let us know. Thanks!

Thanks &amp; Regards,
