    <textOnly>Hi,

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and upon checking, this HO has a fraud flag and SSN mismatch with the bureau which caused the manual review.

Can you confirm if the customer has SSN?

Also, we would like to get a copy of her driverâ€™s license and utility bill for identity verification.

Kindly send it to us at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Regards,
SunPower Team</textOnly>
