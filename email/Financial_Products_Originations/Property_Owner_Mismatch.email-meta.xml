Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of verifying the registered ownership of the above lease agreement. Based upon information from our Title search and address verification report, {!Account.Name} is not the owner of the property. We found out that {PROPERTY OWNER in RQ} appears to be the owner of the property located at {!Account.BillingAddress}.


Please be advised that we do Title Searching as a pre – countersignature requirement to ensure that our applicants are the owner of the property, as such, we can avoid problem/s dealing with Public Utilities Commission (PUC) &amp; Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Filing.  Property ownership is a requirement to participate in our leasing program.


We request you to send us a copy of any of the below documents that would reflect the property ownership of the customer.


• Notarized / County recorded Deed

• HUD Settlement Statement


If the Property is under a TRUST, we opt to require a Grant Deed/Deed of Trust stating the LESSEE as the Grantee or the Beneficiary of the Trust.

Should you have questions, please let us know.


Thanks,
{!Case.OwnerFullName}| Analyst, Financial Products Originations
