    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

Good day.

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and this is in Pending Credit review status.

An email has been sent to the customer asking for the required documents. We have two different types of documentation that he can provide us that will satisfy our requirements.

Specifically we need either:

- An official Mortgage Approval Letter that isn&apos;t conditional or contingent and/or
- A copy of his last tax return and a copy of his last two pay stubs to verify employment

Thanks,

SunPower Team</textOnly>
