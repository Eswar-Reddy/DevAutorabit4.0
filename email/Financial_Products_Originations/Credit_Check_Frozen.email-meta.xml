    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We are not able to evaluate the application of your customer at this time because his TransUnion credit report is frozen. If he wishes to remove the freeze either temporarily or permanently and allow us to resubmit the application, please have him contact TransUnion to remove the freeze:

TransUnion PO Box 1000 Chester PA 19016 800-888-4213 www.transunion.com

Once TransUnion has removed the freeze on his credit report, please provide us  a heads-up so we can reprocess the credit application.

Thank you.

Regards,

SunPower Team</textOnly>
