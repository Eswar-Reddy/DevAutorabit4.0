    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and we have noticed that his address doesn’t match with the bureau’s record.

To move forward, kindly submit a copy of his utility bill for verification.

Thank you,

SunPower Team</textOnly>
