    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and we have noticed that his SSN doesnâ€™t match with his bureau record.

To move forward, please get in touch with him and verify at least the last 4 digits of his SSN.

Thank you.

Regards,
SunPower Team</textOnly>
