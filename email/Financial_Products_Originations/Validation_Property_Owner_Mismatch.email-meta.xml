    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of verifying the Property Address of the above lease agreement. Upon information from our Title search and address verification report, we found out that the Address should be [address in RealQuest] instead of {!Account.BillingAddress}.

Please be advised that we do Title Searching as a pre â€“ countersignature requirement to ensure that the Address where the property is located at is valid and accurate, so we can avoid problem/s dealing with Public Utilities Commission (PUC) &amp; Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Filing.

If the address in the contract is the correct one, we request you to send us a Notarized / County recorded Deed for us to move forward with this lease.
If not, we will decline this for countersignature and you need to create a new contract to reflect the correct address.

Should you have questions, please let us know.  Thanks!

Thank you,
