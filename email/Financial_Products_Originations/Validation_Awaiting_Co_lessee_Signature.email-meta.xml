Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of validating the Lease Contract for the above mentioned homeowner. Upon reviewing, we noticed that the co – lessee has not sign yet.

Please be informed that we cannot proceed to counter – signature unless the co – lessee signs.

A reminder has been sent to them as well for notification.

Let us know if you have further questions.

Thank you,
