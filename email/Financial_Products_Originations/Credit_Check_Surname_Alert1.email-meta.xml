    <textOnly>Hi,

Good day.

We are in the process reviewing the credit application for the above homeowner and we have noticed that he has a surname alert with the bureau which caused the manual review.

To move forward, we would like to request a copy of his driverâ€™s license.

Thank you.

Regards,
