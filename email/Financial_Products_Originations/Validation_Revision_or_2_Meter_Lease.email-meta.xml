Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of validating lease contract for the above homeowner. Upon reviewing, we noticed that there is an existing signed lease and  one waiting for countersignature.

Please inform us whether this is a revision or two – metered property.

1. If it is a revision, please state the reason/s for revision.
2. In cases of two – metered property, kindly provide/attach the copy of the utility bills of the homeowner.

Moving forward, please provide note/s and attach the 2 Utility bills (if 2 metered  property) in the customer&apos;s account so we can proceed with the validation of the new lease.

Should you have further questions, please let us know.

Thank you &amp; Regards,
