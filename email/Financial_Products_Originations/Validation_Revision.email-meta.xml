    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of validating the lease of the above homeowner and we noticed that there is an existing signed lease ({!Contract.ContractNumber}). Is this a revision? If yes, please provide us the reason for revision.

Moving forward, for revision process you can proceed initiating cancellation to the existing lease or provide Notes in customer&apos;s account. We cannot proceed with the new lease unless reason for having a new lease has been provided.

Should you have further questions, please let us know.

Thank you &amp; Regards,
