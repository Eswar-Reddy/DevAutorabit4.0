Hi {!Account.Account_Owner__c},

We are in the process of verifying the property address of the above lease agreement. Based upon information from our Title search and address verification report, the address of the homeowner in the lease is a Mobile Home.

Please be advised that we do Title Searching as a pre – countersignature requirement to ensure that the Address where the property is located at is valid and accurate, so we can avoid problem/s dealing with Public Utilities Commission (PUC) &amp; Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Filing.

We request you to send us the documents for us to move forward.
•        Permanent structure/Picture
•        Permanent foundation/Picture
•       Ownership of parcel/land

Should you have questions, please let us know.  Have a great day!
