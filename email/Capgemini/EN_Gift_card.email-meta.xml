    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.LastName},

You got in touch with the SunPower contact center on {!Case.CreatedDate} and have been in contact with our team since then, regarding an issue you experienced with your installer {!Case.Partner_Name__c}, who no longer has the capacity to assist you.

We understand the difficulties you encountered with this installer, with whom you entered into a direct installation contract. As a result, and regrettably, Sunpower does not have any contractual relationship with you.

However, on an exceptional basis, SunPower decided to arrange an inspection of your photovoltaic system by one of our partners in order to assess the situation and identify the root cause of the technical problem.

Following the partner’s assessment, it was discovered that the inverter/monitoring system was defective. As part of the warranty conditions, we have managed to replace the product.

The after sales process was applied accordingly and the installation is now working correctly.

Furthermore, as defined in our warranty conditions, SunPower cannot be held responsible for the production lost during this intervention.

Therefore, given the difficulties you faced and as an exceptional and discretionary commercial gesture, because you own SunPower PV modules, we are pleased to offer you a 200£ Amazon gift card.  We will send the gift card once we receive your acceptance of this offer by email.

Our customers’ satisfaction is a steadfast commitment and we hope that you are now able to enjoy the quality, durability and performance of your installation.

Please do not hesitate to contact our team in case you need any further information.


Best regards,

{!Case.OwnerFullName} | SunPower Customer Service Representative - UK
