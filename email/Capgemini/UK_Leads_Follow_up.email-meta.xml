In order to proceed, we kindly ask you to provide or confirm the following information:

- Are you the owner of the property?
- What is the address of the installation?
- Which side is it oriented to (South/East/West/North)?
- Size of the roof space available for installation or kW you would like to install.
- Are there any shadows on the roof?
