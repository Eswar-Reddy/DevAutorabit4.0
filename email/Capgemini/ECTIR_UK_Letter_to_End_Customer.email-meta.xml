    <textOnly>Dear Mr / Ms {!Case.Contact},

Thank you for contacting SunPower’s customer service about your photovoltaic system which was installed by {!Case.Partner_Name__c} on DATE.


As this installer is no longer part of SunPower’s Partner network, and as a gesture of goodwill, we would like one of our authorized SunPower Partners to visit your site, at our cost, in order to identify the issues you are experiencing.


In the event of a defect and if SunPower modules are to blame, SunPower’s 25 year warranty will be effective, except in the case of specific exclusions. If the technical issue is caused by elements other than the photovoltaic panels, such as the installation itself, cabling, inverters etc., SunPower’s warranty will not be applicable and further replacement and/or travel costs that may be required will be at your cost if no other guarantee applies.


Please find below the contact information for the Partner who will intervene on site:


&lt;Company name&gt;

&lt;Contact name&gt;

&lt;Company phone number&gt;

&lt;Company email&gt;

&lt;Company website&gt;


The Partner will contact you directly to set up an appointment at a time that is convenient for you.


Please let us know when the appointment has been made.


Rest assured that we are doing everything possible in order to solve this problem quickly and enable you to benefit from the advantages of your photovoltaic system once again.


Providing our clients with the best service is a daily vocation and we sincerely hope that this gesture of our goodwill will bring you satisfaction.

With our very best regards,
