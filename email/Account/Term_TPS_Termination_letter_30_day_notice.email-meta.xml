Dear {!Contact.FirstName},



Please take notice that by this letter, and in accordance with Section 12 (b)(i) (Termination) and 22 (Notices) of the Third Party Seller Participation Agreement (SunPower Third Party Seller Program) (“Agreement”), which states in relevant part:


“Either party to this Agreement may terminate this Agreement by providing thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SunPower may terminate this Agreement and Third Party Seller’s participation in the Third Party Seller Program at any time and for any reason.”



SunPower hereby terminates the Agreement currently in effect with {!Account.Name} as a third party seller effective thirty (30) days from the date of this letter.




As a result, {!Account.Name} is no longer an authorized third party seller of SunPower products. Accordingly, you should cease all use of SunPower’s name, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements, and note that the following sections of the Agreement survive termination of the Agreement: “SunPower Brand Use”; “Indemnity; Insurance; Limitation of Liability; Claims”; and “Privacy; Confidentiality and Intellectual Property”.





Thank you for your business, and we wish you well in future endeavors.
Sincerely,
