Please be aware that all surviving aspects and requirements of the Agreements remain in effect, including, but not limited to Sections 7 (d), (e), and (f), of the SunPower Residential Dealer Agreement, which state:

In addition, Dealer shall deliver to SunPower or destroy within 30 days (at SunPower’s option and at no cost to SunPower) all items bearing Brand Elements;

(ii) Dealer shall immediately cease using any of SunPower’s Confidential Information in any capacity whatsoever and return to SunPower all copies of manuals and other confidential materials to which SunPower provided Dealer access. Dealer may not sell, trade, or otherwise profit in any way from any Confidential Information (including Customer-specific information) at any time after the termination or expiration of this Agreement;

(iii) Accrued balance of Dealer Program Fund is forfeited; and



(iv) Dealer may not make disparaging remarks about SunPower or the Products.


(f) Upon this Agreement’s termination with cause, Dealer shall cease to be an authorized dealer of Products, and all amounts owed by Dealer to SunPower shall become immediately due and payable (despite any prior sales terms.


Accordingly, all items listed above should be returned to SunPower immediately and you should cease all use of SunPower’s name, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements and note that your signed “Agreement of Nondisclosure” remains on file.
