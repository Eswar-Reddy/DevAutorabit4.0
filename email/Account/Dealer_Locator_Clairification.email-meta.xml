    <textOnly>This notification provides confirmation that {!Account.Name} is an active - contracted - member of SunPower&apos;s North American reseller program as of &lt;TODAY&apos;S DATE&gt;. SunPower&apos;s Dealer Locator, launched on our consumer site in the Fall of 2010, was designed to display a finite number of Partners in any given region. {!Account.Name}&apos;s exclusion from this list in no way implies that they have not met the stringent requirements to become a SunPower Dealer/Partner.

Please feel free to contact your RSM or Partner Experience if you have any questions and thank you again for choosing to work with SunPower.
