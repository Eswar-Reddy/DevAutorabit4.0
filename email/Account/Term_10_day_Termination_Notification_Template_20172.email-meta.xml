NOTICE OF DEALER AGREEMENT TERMINATION





(Date)



{!Contact.Name}

{!Account.Name}

{!Account.BillingStreet},

Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Please take notice that by this letter, and in accordance with Section 8(b)(iii) of the SunPower Residential Reseller Agreement, SunPower hereby terminates the &quot;Agreement&quot; currently in effect with {!Account.Name} as an Authorized Residential Partner effective ten (10) days from the date of this notice. SunPower is taking this action because of the overdue balance that {!Account.Name} fails to settle with SunPower.



As a result, {!Account.Name} is no longer an authorized dealer of SunPower Products (as such term is defined in the Agreement) and is thus no longer in good standing under the RVAR Agreement and no longer an authorized lease originator and installer under the SunPower lease program&apos;s SunPower Dealer Participation Agreement (SunPower Residential Solar Lease Program) (&quot;DPA&quot;).





Please be aware that all surviving aspects and requirements of the Residential Dealer Agreement remain in effect, including Sections 8 (d), (e) and (f), which read:




(d) SunPower may, at its sole option, cancel any unshipped Product orders without any liability once either party sends a notice of termination…



(e) Upon this Agreement’s expiration or termination with or without cause, Dealer shall cease to be an authorized

dealer of Products, and:


(i) If so requested by SunPower at its option, Dealer shall resell (at Dealer’s original cost, less damage and restocking fee) and deliver to SunPower, any portion (in SunPower’s discretion) of those Products purchased under this Agreement which are in Dealer’s inventory. In addition, Dealer shall deliver to SunPower or destroy within 30 days (at SunPower’s option and at no cost to SunPower) all items bearing Brand Elements;

(ii) Dealer shall immediately cease using any of SunPower’s Confidential Information in any capacity whatsoever and return to SunPower all copies of manuals and other confidential materials to which SunPower provided Dealer access. Dealer may not sell, trade, or otherwise profit in any way from any Confidential Information (including Customer-specific information) at any time after the termination or expiration of this Agreement; and

(iii) Dealer may not make disparaging remarks about SunPower or the Products.


(f) Upon this Agreement’s termination with cause, Dealer shall cease to be an authorized dealer of Products, and all amounts owed by Dealer to SunPower shall become immediately due and payable (despite any prior sales terms).


Accordingly, all items listed above should be returned to SunPower immediately and you should cease all use of SunPower’s name, trademarks, logos, and other branding elements and note that your signed “Agreement of Nondisclosure” remains on file.



Thank you for your business, and we wish you well in future endeavors.
Sincerely,


Katherine Arnaud
