    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}:,


Your request to access SunPower Helix Design Studio (HDS) has been completed.


Please note that only one person in your company has access to a free trial, which expires on September 1st, 2017. After this date, the license will cost $181.00 per month. Additional users will also be charged $181.00 per month per user, starting from the time the license is enabled.


You can now launch HDS from any commercial opportunity you’ve created in the SunPower partner connect site.

To do so, simply login to https://www.sunpowerpartnerconnect.com with your credentials, click on the Opportunities tab, and select any commercial opportunity.

Under the Sites section, you should see a new large button labeled “LAUNCH DESIGN TOOL”. Clicking on this button will single-sign on to HDS and create a project automatically with the site address and name.


To start using HDS for the first time, you’ll need to “star” specific SunPower modules and inverters in the HDS database.

Once in HDS, please take the following steps:


1. Click on the Database tab at the top of the screen, which will load the Modules section
2. On the top-right corner of the screen, type SunPower in the Manufacturer search box
3. Click on the star icon next to the following modules, which will turn the star yellow and move the starred modules to the top of the list (you may have to move to the next page to find all the modules:

SPR-E20-327-COM
SPR-E20-435-COM
SPR-X21-345-COM
SPR-X22-360-COM
SPR-P17-340-COM
SPR-P17-350-COM

4. Click on the Inverters tab on the left navigation bar, which will load the Inverters section
5. On the top-right corner of the screen, type SMA in the Manufacturer search box
6. Click on the star icon next to the following inverters, which will turn the star yellow and move the starred inverters to the top of the list (you may have to move to the next page to find all the inverter:

STP 12000-TL-US-10
STP 15000-TL-US-10
STP 20000-TL-US-10
STP 24000-TL-US-10

7. Non-SunPower modules and inverters can also be setup for use by being starred in the database, however please note that they will not be available in the Helix Single Tilt and Dual Tilt presets.


Please note that you only need to take these steps once, and the changes will apply to all projects you create in HDS.


If you have any questions or concerns about HDS, please contact digital.support@sunpowercorp.com.
