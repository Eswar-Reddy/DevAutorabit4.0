    <subject>Welcome to The SunPower Alliance Program!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},

Thank you for choosing to be a part of SunPower Alliance Program!

We would like to give you a brief overview. Alliance Program is a lead-generation program offered to Elite and Premier dealers, wherein SunPower establishes partnerships (employers, associations, affinity groups) who offer the solar program to their employees and/or members. These customers receive post installation rebates for their SunPower system.

SunPower provides:
* Education (informational sessions, webinars), which we work with the local Alliance Dealer in the area
* Solar rebate (specific to the organization)
* Online infrastructure (custom, co-branded website, sign-ups)
* Ongoing customer service (dedicated 800#, web support, rebate processing)

SunPower will send the leads that are generated to participating Dealers only. With this, participating Dealers will contribute a $0.30/watt (max up to $1500) to the homeowner rebate when a system is sold [via debit memo]. The rebate form will also be sent together with the lead information and instructions thereafter.

Training slides and other information are available in the Dealer Portal.

We are looking forward to working with you.


Best,
 
The Alliance Team
