Dear {!Contact.FirstName},






We are writing to inform you that we have erroneously credited the bonus for 2H 2012 performance in your Dealer Program Fund (DPFund) amounting to $_________ last January ______(date of accrual) 2013.



Upon reviewing your account and the metrics that are required to hit the bonus, namely “Bonus for Meeting the 6 Month Revenue Target”, “Bonus for Meeting All Tier Requirements” and “Bonus for SunPower Co-Marketing”, {!Account.Name} did not meet the requirements for _________(Tier) and should not have received the DPFund accrual for the said period.



With this, please expect an adjustment to your DPFund on __________(adjustment date) and please accept our sincere apologies for this error.



If you have questions related to your status as a (Tier) dealer, please feel free to email us at Channel.Development@sunpowercorp.com. We are more than willing to help you with your concerns.
Sincerely,


Theo Ludwick

North America Residential Channel Manager
