1 Pre-payment amount shown above is based on your current available credit. The required pre-payment will change as your available credit changes. If pre-payment will not be settled by mm/dd/yy, order cancellation penalties will apply.

Once accepted, order cannot be canceled or changed without prior written approval by SunPower.  An order is considered “accepted” after SunPower receives a valid purchase order from the Dealer, SunPower and the Dealer agree to the scheduled delivery date via email confirmations, and the Dealer submits the required 5% non-refundable down payment.

If any of the information listed above appears incorrect, please contact us immediately, especially regarding any special requests for the inverter (ARRA compliant, Grounding, Zone Monitoring Capability).

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to meet your requested system delivery date of {!Opportunity.Projected_Delivery_Date__c}, due to insufficient availability for both the PV and Inverter(s), which you have selected for this project.

As a result, your system delivery date will occur on {!Opportunity.Delivery_Date__c}.

If your system delivery date can be moved up, or if there are any other changes, we will notify you accordingly.

If this is acceptable, please reply with your approval within 48 hours, otherwise your purchase order is subject to cancellation.
